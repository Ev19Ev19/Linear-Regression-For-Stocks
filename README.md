# Linear-Regression-For-Stocks

What I Did

In this project, I built a simple Python program with the help of AI to predict a stock price. I used data from Polygon.io to get the last 10 days of a stocks daily Open and Close prices. With AIâ€™s help, I wrote a program that fits a weighted linear regression model which gives more importance to recent days. The program shows a clear chart of the real Open and Close prices, the trend lines, and the predicted Open and Close for tomorrow.

Why I Did It

I wanted to practice working with real stock market data and learn how to use linear regression to find trends and make predictions. I also wanted to use AI as a tool to help me write and improve my code because it makes learning faster and more interesting. This project helped me see how AI can help with coding, debugging, and explaining technical concepts step by step.

How I Did It

I used Python with popular libraries like pandas for data handling, numpy for calculations, scikit-learn for linear regression, and matplotlib for charts. With help from AI, I learned how to connect to the Polygon.io API and download the daily stock prices. I selected the most recent 10 days and fitted separate weighted linear regression models for the Open and Close prices, making sure that recent days affect the prediction more than older days. Finally, I used AI suggestions to improve my plot so it shows the real prices, trend lines, and predicted prices clearly.
